## Inspiration

In 2020, we met Sarah, an elderly voter from rural Georgia. Despite her unwavering desire to participate in voting, she faced a significant challenge: living 15 miles from her polling station with no transportation options. Her story isn't unique ‚Äì millions of Americans face similar barriers to voting.

That's when Ride2Vote was born.

What started as a small group of volunteers offering rides to local polling stations has evolved into a nationwide movement. Today, Ride2Vote connects thousands of volunteer drivers with voters who need transportation, ensuring that distance never stands between a citizen and their right to vote.

## How We Built It üöÄ

We developed **Ride2Vote** using **React.js** for a dynamic, responsive frontend, ensuring an easy-to-use interface for both voters and volunteer drivers. **React Router DOM** handled navigation, while **Framer Motion** added smooth animations for a polished experience. We used **React Icons** and **custom CSS** to keep the design modern and accessible.

For secure user authentication, we integrated **Auth0**, allowing both riders and drivers to register and log in easily. Drivers can register their vehicle info, specify accessibility preferences, and track their impact through a **leaderboard system**. Riders can quickly request rides and customize their preferences, with **real-time driver matching**.

We also built an interactive **Voting Knowledge Quiz** to educate users about the election process and boost engagement.

### Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è
- **Frontend**: React.js, React Router DOM, Framer Motion, React Icons, Custom CSS
- **Authentication**: Auth0
- **Real-Time Chat**: WebSockets
- **Backend**: Firebase
- **Deployment**: Netlify

This tech stack helped us create a seamless platform that connects voters with volunteer drivers, ensuring access to polling stations and empowering young voters nationwide.
