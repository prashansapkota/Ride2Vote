## Inspiration

During the presidential election of 2024, our friend Alex, a driven college student who was ready to cast their first vote. But Alex lived miles away from the nearest polling station, with no access to reliable transportation. For Alex, and millions of young voters like them, the simple act of voting becomes an uphill battle due to transportation barriers.

This is why Ride2Vote was born.

It's no longer just an idea but a movement that started as an effort to bridge that gap with young voters. Ride2Vote connects passionate volunteers to young voters who need a ride so that nobody silences their voice based on distance. We believe giving them the means to reach the polls empowers our youth, and de provide the ride that drives civic engagement toward assurance that every young voice will shape the future.

## How We Built It üöÄ

We developed **Ride2Vote** using **React.js** for a dynamic, responsive frontend, ensuring an easy-to-use interface for both voters and volunteer drivers. **React Router DOM** handled navigation, while **Framer Motion** added smooth animations for a polished experience. We used **React Icons** and **custom CSS** to keep the design modern and accessible.

For secure user authentication, we integrated **Auth0**, allowing both riders and drivers to register and log in easily. Drivers can register their vehicle info, specify accessibility preferences, and track their impact through a **leaderboard system**. Riders can quickly request rides and customize their preferences, with **real-time driver matching**.

We also built an interactive **Voting Knowledge Quiz** to educate users about the election process and boost engagement.

### Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è
- **Frontend**: React.js, React Router DOM, Framer Motion, React Icons, Custom CSS
- **Authentication**: Auth0
- **Real-Time Chat**: WebSockets

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of üéâ

Our team put in significant effort to create Ride2Vote, a platform that connects young voters with volunteer drivers to ensure everyone has access to polling locations. Here are some of the accomplishments we're most proud of:

### Effective User Verification and Communication
- **Driver and Rider Verification**: We implemented a system for user profiles that will eventually allow drivers and riders to verify their identities, ensuring that everyone can trust the platform. 
- **Secure Communication**: We designed the platform to allow secure communication only between matched riders and drivers, protecting users‚Äô privacy.

### Optimized Ride Matching
- **Easy Ride Requests**: We developed a ride request form that allows voters to submit their transportation needs. Drivers can easily browse the available requests and select the ones that fit their schedule and location, streamlining the matching process.

### Engaging Gamified Platform
- **Interactive Quizzes and Rewards**: To encourage user participation, we incorporated fun and educational quizzes about voting. We also created a rewards system with badges like ‚ÄúQuiz Master‚Äù and ‚ÄúTop Contributor‚Äù to motivate users to engage with the platform and learn more about the voting process.

### User-Centered Experience
- **Intuitive Design**: We focused on a simple, intuitive design that makes it easy for users to navigate through the platform, from signing up to requesting rides and completing quizzes.
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Our design is responsive and works seamlessly across different devices, ensuring a wide range of users can access and benefit from the app.

### Accessibility Features
- **Special Needs Accommodations**: We integrated features to allow drivers to specify what special accommodations they can provide (e.g., wheelchair accessibility), and riders can request specific accommodations for their ride.

We‚Äôre incredibly proud of what we‚Äôve built and excited about the potential for Ride2Vote to help increase voter turnout and ensure access to the polls for everyone.

## What We Learned üìö
Throughout the development of Ride2Vote, we learned that creating an app that serves both logistical needs and fosters trust between users requires a thoughtful and secure approach. From user verification to ride matching and accessibility features, each challenge provided valuable lessons on how to create a comprehensive platform that truly meets the needs of voters and volunteer drivers.

## What‚Äôs Next for Ride2Vote üöÄ
Moving forward, we plan to implement a backend system that will handle user authentication, ride requests, and communication between drivers and riders. Additionally, we‚Äôll work on enhancing the verification system with more robust ID checks and enable a real-time chat feature for better interaction between users. We‚Äôll also be looking to integrate a mapping system to better facilitate ride matching and tracking.
