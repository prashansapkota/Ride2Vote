## Inspiration

The inspiration for ECo-nnect came from a simple yet powerful moment. One day, while shopping with a friend, I noticed his hesitation in choosing a product. As someone passionate about sustainability, I shared how small choices—like picking eco-friendly products or reducing waste—can significantly impact the environment in the long run. Despite my enthusiasm, I realized that word-of-mouth alone wouldn’t inspire lasting change.

That’s when it hit: What if sustainability were easy and accessible to all? Thus began ECo-nnect—a platform that would empower users to make informed, eco-friendly decisions in everyday life. From product scanning for sustainability insights to offering ideas for repurposing discarded items, ECo-nnect strives to make every choice count.
